        <p class="syno">The story of our game tells about a couple in New Hampshire who, after a long day of walking, decide to spend the night in the only hotel in the small town of Whispy Woods. After collecting their key from reception, they go to their room on the third floor to rest, room 364. From then on, strange things start to happen. A thud knocks on their door. Opening the door, the protagonists realize that no one is there. Suddenly, the upstairs lights start to crackle and then go out. Only one small light remains on in room 364. Determined to report the problem to reception, they set out to find a flashlight in their belongings. As they step out into the deserted corridor on the third floor, they notice that the elevator, the only way down to reception, has broken down due to the power failure. Stranded, they decide to find a way of restoring it themselves by exploring the floor...</p>

My main task was to create the game's entire 3D environment, including lighting and collisions. I was also in charge of implementing the artificial intelligence. I won't tell you more about it, you'll get to know it better in the game ðŸ˜‰ . I hope you enjoy what we've managed to produce for you ðŸ¤ž</p>

If you have any criticism of this site, I'll bite (that's not true, I'm very niceðŸ™ƒ). As you may have guessed, I was in charge of the site, but also of all the game menus, and assisted in many tasks (I make great coffees, with or without sugar). In short, enjoy playing our masterpiece!</p>

I did most of the scripting for the project, some of the coding for the puzzles and I also came up with a lot of the sounds for the game. I also produced the game plans (beautiful schematics) and a small part of the game's events. But most of all, I took care of our sublime logo, without which our game wouldn't be as good (in all modesty, of course). I hope you enjoy our little gem!</p>

I also worked on the user interface and created the game's installation executable. It's possible that I got a bit irritated after a few bugs, which earns me this title. My favorite hobby? Shouting "ONE HOUR?" to group members on their way to lunch. Enjoy our game to the max!</p>
